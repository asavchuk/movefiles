This utility moves files to another drive once a day. Source folder and destination folder (drive) are provided through command options where the first should be a source and the second one is a destination place. For example:  
```
movefiles.exe d:/export/ //SUNSEY2/d$/Temp_Почта/
```

> go build -ldflags="-s -w -H windowsgui"
